  description: 'Adversaries may execute active reconnaissance scans to gather information
    that can be used during targeting. Active scans are those where the adversary
    probes victim infrastructure via network traffic, as opposed to other forms of
    reconnaissance that do not involve direct interaction.

    

    Adversaries
    may perform different forms of active scanning depending on what information
    they seek to gather. These scans can also be performed in various ways, including
    using native features of network protocols such as ICMP.[1][2] Information from
    these scans may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Search
    Open Websites/Domains or Search Open Technical Databases), establishing operational
    resources (ex: Develop Capabilities or Obtain Capabilities), and/or initial access
    (ex: External Remote Services or Exploit Public-Facing Application).'
